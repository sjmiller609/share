app for find a buddy to do an activity with

menu that is tree structure


physical
	gym
		lift
		raquetball
		soccer
		whatever
study
	chemistry
		101
		ochem

etc.

the app would be kind of like tinder and uber i guess
you pick an activity then it matches you to a person
at the end, you give them a thumbs up or down
	if up, then they are added as your "budi" on the back end
	when searching for a partner for an activity, budis are prioritized.
	like linkedin, it knows if you are a 2nd / 3rd connection, and also prioritizes that, but it's hidden on the backend
