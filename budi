app for find a buddy to do an activity with

menu that is tree structure


physical
	gym
		lift
		raquetball
		soccer
		whatever
study
	chemistry
		101
		ochem

etc.

the app would be kind of like tinder and uber i guess
you pick an activity then it matches you to a person
at the end, you give them a thumbs up or down
	if up, then they are added as your "budi" on the back end
	when searching for a partner for an activity, budis are prioritized.
	like linkedin, it knows if you are a 2nd / 3rd connection, and also prioritizes that, but it's hidden on the backend

this idea is kind of cool bc there are a lot of potential applications to having a "friend network" stored in memory like this.
also it is interesting bc if a bunch of people were using this it would automagically create friend group irl since the same ppl would start to link to each other a lot.
it's kind of optimizing by if you like them / schdule bc you don't plan aheaad with people, it just looks for people who are also currently searching

what do do if nobody esle is searching right then? scalability
